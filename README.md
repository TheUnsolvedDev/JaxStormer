## Sections

 - Introduction to JAX
Learn the basics of JAX, how to work with JAX arrays, and leverage automatic differentiation for gradient-based optimization.

 - Linear Regression with JAX
Implement linear regression using JAX, apply gradient descent for optimization, and incorporate normalization and scaling techniques.

 - Logistic Regression with JAX
Build a logistic regression model with JAX, including regularization to prevent overfitting, and evaluate classification accuracy and ROC-AUC.

 - Support Vector Machines (SVM) with JAX
Implement linear SVM using JAX, explore non-linear SVM with the kernel trick, and fine-tune hyperparameters for improved performance.

 - Naive Bayes Classifier with JAX
Implement Gaussian Naive Bayes using JAX, handle categorical and continuous features, and evaluate classification performance.

 - Neural Networks with JAX
Build feedforward neural networks using JAX, implement forward and backward passes, and train using gradient descent.

 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with JAX
Implement CNN architecture using JAX, including convolutional and pooling layers, and apply it to image classification tasks.

 - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with JAX
Implement RNNs for sequential data using JAX, explore LSTM and GRU cells, and generate sequences and perform language modelling.

 - Applying JAX to Real-world Datasets
Work with real-world datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, etc., preprocess data, augment using JAX, and build end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
